<details><summary>What is HTML</summary>
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It's the standard markup language used to create web pages. HTML provides the structure for the content that appears on web browsers. Think of it like the "skeleton" of a web page, providing a place for other technologies like CSS (styling) and JavaScript (interactivity) to attach to.
