<details><summary>What is HTML?</summary>
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the language used to display webpages. It is extremely difficult (if not impossible) to find a webpage that does not use HTML. HTML has a variety of elements to use, such as headings(<h1>), paragraphs(<p>), buttons(<button>), links (<li>), title (<title>), and many more. You can display your desired info in these elements, including being able to add titles to your paragraphs and linking to a different webpage.

<details><summary>How to create an HTML page from a wireframe?</summary>
Before beginning your your HTML webpage, you should plan ahead and decide what will be displayed on the page. It is advised to make a rough draft of how you wish for your page to be layed out. It doesn't need to look pretty, just legible.

Next you ascertain which elements you want to include. If you want a title for your page, you will need to use <title>. If you want a navbar to link to different pages, use the <li> element. Knowing which elements you will need is integral to designing your website.

<details><summary>What is the DOM?</summary>
Javascript can be implemented in an HTML code. However, depending on the size of your index, navigating and pointing to certain elements can be difficult. Which is why it is important to label and organize your elements. Thats where DOM comes in. DOM stands for Document Object Model. When an HTML is loaded, DOM is loaded as well and keeps track of elements with a specific id, name, or any other selector.
